The SSA Office of the Inspector General is committed to making https://oig.ssa.gov accessible to people with disabilities. To ensure that we meet or exceed the requirements of the [1998 Amendment to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://section508.gov/) (link is external), we continually review our site and modify pages to remove accessibility problems for people with disabilities.

## WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE
Please report website accessibility problems to the Office of the Inspector General at OIG.OER@ssa.gov. Please include the site address or URL and the specific problems you have encountered in your message.

## LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES
Some pages on this website may contain links to third party sites not operated by the Office of the Inspector General. These sites may not adhere to similar privacy, security, or accessibility policies and standards. The Office of the Inspector General is not responsible for the content and accessibility of those sites, their partners, or advertisers.
