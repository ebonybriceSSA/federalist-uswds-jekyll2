# Our Mission 

The Inspector General Act of 1978 was passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal, as a means of ensuring integrity and accountability in the Executive Branch. The law created independent and objective organizations to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to agency programs and operations.

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the Social Security Administration (SSA) was established on March 31, 1995, pursuant to the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994.


## Who We Are 

The OIG is directly responsible for meeting the statutory mission of promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of SSA programs and operations and to prevent and detect fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in such programs and operations. To accomplish this mission, we direct, conduct, and supervise a comprehensive program of audits, evaluations, and investigations relating to SSA's programs and operations. We also search for and report systemic weaknesses in SSA programs and operations, and make recommendations for needed improvements and corrective actions.

## What We Do 

We strive for continual improvement in SSA’s programs, operations, and management by proactively seeking new ways to prevent and deter fraud, waste, and abuse. We commit to integrity and excellence by supporting an environment that provides a valuable public service while encouraging employee development and retention and fostering diversity and innovation.

## Why We Do It

By conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, and investigations, we inspire public confidence in the integrity and security of SSA’s programs and operations and protect them against fraud, waste, and abuse. We provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to Administration officials, Congress, and the public.

## Our Community

Our Inspector General is part of a large community(link is external) of Inspectors General.  We are a part of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), an independent entity within the executive branch whose purpose is to increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies, standards, and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well-trained and highly skilled workforce in the Offices of Inspectors General.
